## Use
Icons are used to visually support themes and actions. Icons are used in SBB style for use in SBB applications. Details on this and a set of already available icons can be found <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/foundation/assets/icons/">here</sbb-link>. {.lead}

## Rules
* The use of icons within body copy should be avoided as far as possible. {.lead}
* Icons without text must be self-explanatory or easy to learn. The more icons used in an application, the more difficult it becomes to understand their meaning. {.lead}
* Icons should always have the same meaning (consistency) across all applications. {.lead}

## Accessibility
* Icons without text must include an alternative text.
* The icon itself does not have to be described but instead its function in text form (e.g. ‘close menu’). {.lead}
