## What does the pattern do?
* Allows users to give direct feedback on an output.

## When should the pattern be used?
* For GenAI outputs.
* If you want to feed the feedback back into the AI model. 


## Recommendation
* A common pattern is thumbs up/down.
* Communicate (e.g. after feedback has been given) what will be done with the feedback.
