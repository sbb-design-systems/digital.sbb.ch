## What does the pattern do?
* Indicates the sources used and therefor increases confidence in the output. 

## When should the pattern be used?
* If it is important that the source is clearly visible and can be found quickly. 
* In ‘higher risk’ contexts, e.g. when it comes to laws, tariffs or finances. 

## Recommendation
* For more than one source: Refer to the source in the correct place in the output.
* Link the sources so that they can be accessed.
* Optionally, you can enter additional information such as publication date or page number.
