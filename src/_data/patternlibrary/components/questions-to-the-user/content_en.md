## What does the pattern do?
* Gets more information from users. 

## When should the pattern be used?
* If the input is not clearly understandable.


## Recommendation
* More information can be obtained via simple request. 
* Or through ready-made answers that are given to choose from. (To be used if possible, as less effort for users).
