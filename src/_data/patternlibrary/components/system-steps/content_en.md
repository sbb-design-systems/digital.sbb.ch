## What does the pattern do?
* Makes it easier to understand what the AI is doing. 

## When should the pattern be used?
* Always indicate that the AI is doing something (especially if it takes longer).
* In ‘higher risk’ contexts, e.g. when it comes to laws, tariffs or finances.
* When the AI needs to do a more complex task. 


## Recommendation
* Communicate how the AI interprets the prompt in a simple, comprehensible way.  
* Display the steps the system takes up to the output.
* And give users the opportunity to intervene in the process.
