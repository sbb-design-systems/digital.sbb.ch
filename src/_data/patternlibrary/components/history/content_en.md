## What does the pattern do?
* Stores search queries or other preferences of users.

## When should the pattern be used?
* For AI chats.

## Recommendation
*  Check how important the feature is for your users and determine whether the search history must always be displayed or can be opened on request. 
* The search queries should be interactive so that you can re-enter or delete them right away.


## Examples
*   History collapsed
*   History open
