## What does the pattern do?
* Expand actions or prompts to multiple cells or objects.

## When should the pattern be used?
* When actions are to be performed on several objects.
* Commonly used in tables. 



## Recommendation
* Show some sample entries before all cells in a column are filled.
* Pay attention to how the AI should overwrite existing entries.
