## What does the pattern do?
* Communicates when the AI cannot answer.  

## When should the pattern be used?
* If there is no matching data available, so there is no output.

## Recommendation
* Communicate appropriately for each case, e.g. ‘We don’t have any corresponding data...’ or ‘It seems as...’
* Offer a way to get back on the right path ‘...Try another question’.
