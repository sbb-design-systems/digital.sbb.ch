## What does the pattern do?
* Supports users in narrowing down. 

## When should the pattern be used?
* When users want to restrict their input (e.g. to primary sources) or output (e.g. format). 



## Recommendation
* Closely related to parameters. Check which one makes more sense.
* Use filters that are relevant. 
* Consider which order makes sense, e.g. what is filtered most often, should come first.
