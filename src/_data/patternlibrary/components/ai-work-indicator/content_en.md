## What does the pattern do?
* Shows users that the system is currently working. 

## When should the pattern be used?
* To inform users that the AI is doing something in the background. 
* If the generation or search takes longer than a moment.



## Recommendation
* The progress of the system can be displayed in different ways, e.g. with a classic loading indicator or textual (‘Write...’).
* The pattern can be combined with a ‘Stop’ button. 


## Examples
*   System is writing
*   Loading indicator within a table
