## What does the pattern do?
* Allows interactions within an AI output.

## When should the pattern be used?
* If the user wants to edit or reference part of the output text.

## Recommendation
* The actions are only displayed when the text has been selected.
* The new prompt can be created either in a context dialog or in the general text input field with a reference to the selected text.
* For the former, the text is completely overwritten and therefore the user should confirm the action.
