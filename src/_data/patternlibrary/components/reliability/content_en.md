## What does the pattern do?
* Indicates how confident the system is in its response.  

## When should the pattern be used?
* In ‘higher-risk’ contexts, such as legislation, tariffs or finances.
* When a decision is to be made based on the output. 

## Recommendation
* Use a form that is well understood: This can be a percentage, a progressive or verbal (‘probable,’ ‘uncertain’).
