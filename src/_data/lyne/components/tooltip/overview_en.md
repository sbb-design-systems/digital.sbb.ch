## What does the component do?
The tooltip component displays additional information contextually and non-dominantly without interrupting the user flow.

## When should the component be used?
The tooltip component is used when additional notes, explanations, or assistance are needed for an element. Tooltips are particularly well suited for:
* Explaining icons, abbreviations, or technical terms
* Providing additional information about controls

## Rules
* The information in the tooltip should be short, precise, and understandable.
* Do not use interactive elements (such as buttons or links) within a tooltip â€” only text is allowed.
* The tooltip text must not contain essential content or mandatory information.
