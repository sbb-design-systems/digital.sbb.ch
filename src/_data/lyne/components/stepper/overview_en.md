## What does the component do?
The stepper component can be used to guide you through a multi-step process. It displays the current progress and (optionally) allows you to navigate between the individual steps. 

## When should the component be used?
* When a process consists of several logical steps.
* When certain steps have to be completed in a fixed order.
* When clear structuring and guidance through a process is required.

## Rules
* The labels of the individual steps should be as short and meaningful as possible.
* If the number of steps is too large, the vertical variant should be used.
