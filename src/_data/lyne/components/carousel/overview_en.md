## What does the component do?
A carousel is an interactive element for displaying multiple pieces of content within a limited area. It displays one or more pieces of content at a time and allows horizontal scrolling using navigation elements or gestures.

## When should the component be used?
* When several similar pieces of content are to be displayed, but there is not enough space for all of them at once.
* When the focus is on a visual or content sequence (e.g., highlights, campaigns, products).
* When space is limited and content needs to be presented in a space-saving manner.

## Rules
* No more than 7 slides should be used.
* Each slide should have a clear focus.
* Carousels should not change automatically—only manual control by the user.
