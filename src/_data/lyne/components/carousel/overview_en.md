## What does the component do?
A card is a flexible container element that combines different types of content and actions in a single block.

## When should the component be used?
* To present related information in a compact way.
* To bring visual hierarchies and structure to a page.
* To display content such as text and actions together.

## Rules
* The content within a card should be logically related and well structured. The content should be formulated as precisely as possible.
* If a card has several interactive elements, the click targets should be placed on the interactive elements used. If the card has only one interactive element, the entire card can be used as a click target.
