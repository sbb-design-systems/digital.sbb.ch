## What does the component do?
A mini calendar is a component that displays date information as compactly and space-savingly as possible and allows it to be selected optionally.

## When should the component be used?
* To give users the opportunity to consume a lot of date information.
* To display recurring events and their patterns.

## Rules
* Several months or entire years can be displayed.
* The component is not accessible and should only be used in contexts (e.g., internal applications) where accessibility is not required.
