## What does the component do?
The sidebar is a vertical navigation bar that is used to structure content within an application. It enables quick and intuitive navigation between different areas or functions of the application. The sidebar can contain menu items and offers space for additional interactive elements such as search fields or filters.

## When should the component be used?
* When an application requires permanent or easily accessible navigation.
* When users need to switch quickly between several main areas.
* When additional functions or filters should be available alongside the main content.

## Rules
* The sidebar can be combined with the icon sidebar. In this case, either the icon sidebar or sidebar should use the ‘milk’ colour variant so that the two components can be visually differentiated.
