## What does the component do?
The component offers suggestions to the user during input, based on existing data or previous input, to make input easier and faster.

## When should the component be used?
* To improve the data input experience by suggesting possible/allowed inputs.
* To increase the accuracy and consistency of the data input.
* To reduce the time users need to fill in forms.

## Rules
* The component should not be used for small data sets (e.g. only 10 entries/options).
* The autocomplete list should not display too many suggestions at once in order to maintain clarity (max. 10 suggestions).
* Users should be able to ignore the autocomplete function and make their own entries.
