## What does the component do?
A radio button allows users to make a selection from a group of options, whereby only one option can be selected at a time.

## When should the component be used?
* When users should make a selection from a limited number of options.
* When only one option may be selected from several possible options.

## Rules
* Radio buttons should be used in groups (radio-button-group) to provide a clear choice.
* Each option within a radio-button-group should be clearly labelled and easy to understand.
* Avoid placing too many options in a radio button group to ensure clarity and to make selection easier.
