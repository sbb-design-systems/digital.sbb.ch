## What does the component do?
An icon is a graphic symbol that is used to visually represent functions, content or actions and improve the user experience.

## When should the component be used?
* To visually support and emphasise functions or actions.
* To save space and create an intuitive user interface.
* To make important information or status messages quickly recognisable.
* To support navigation and improve the findability of content.

## Rules
* Icons are available in 3 sizes (24 x 24, 36 x 36 and 48 x 48 pixels). Other sizes are not permitted.
* The icons are displayed in a line width of 1 pixel. Exceptions are only permitted in the header.
* Make sure that the size of the icons matches the surrounding font and other elements.
* Use icons sparingly and only where they actually improve the user experience.
* If possible, offer a text alternative or tooltip to explain the meaning of the icon.
