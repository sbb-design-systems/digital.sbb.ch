## What does the component do?
The Paginator component enables navigation through large amounts of content by dividing the content into several pages. It shows users which page they are on and provides control elements for switching between pages.

## When should the component be used?
* When a large number of entries or content needs to be managed efficiently.
* When an alternative to infinite scrolling is required.

## Rules
* If the number of pages is small, an alternative solution such as ‘Load more’ can be considered instead of a paginator.
