## What does the component do?
The icon sidebar is a vertical navigation bar that is used to structure content within an application. It enables quick and intuitive navigation between different areas or functions of the application. The icon sidebar can contain links or buttons.

## When should the component be used?
* When an application requires permanent or easily accessible navigation.
* When users need to switch quickly between several main areas.

## Rules
* The icon sidebar can be combined with the sidebar. In this case, either the icon sidebar or sidebar should use the ‘milk’ colour variant so that the two components can be visually differentiated.
