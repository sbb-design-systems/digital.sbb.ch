## What does the component do?
A title component is used to display headings and titles in different sizes and hierarchy levels in order to present content in a structured and clear manner.

## When should the component be used?
* To highlight the main heading of a page or section.
* To present the structure and hierarchy of content clearly and comprehensibly.
* To draw the user's attention to important information or topics.

## Rules
* Use the title component in different hierarchy levels (e.g. H1, H2, H3) to ensure a clear structure and readability.
* Make sure that titles are used semantically correctly to improve accessibility and search engine optimisation (SEO).
* Avoid too many titles on a page to ensure clarity.
