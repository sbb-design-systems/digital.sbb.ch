## What does the component do?
The chip component is a compact UI element that is used to display selected values within a form field. Each chip represents a selection and can be removed again if required.

## When should the component be used?
* When users can select multiple values from a list.
* If the selected values are to be displayed visually in the input field.
* When an easy way to remove individual entries is required.

## Rules
* Each chip should contain a clearly legible label text, as short and concise as possible.
* When labelling, make sure that they are easily distinguishable from each other.
