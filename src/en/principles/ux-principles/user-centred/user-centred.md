Real users are involved in the development of a solution regularly and from an early stage. Their involvement in a project is a fixed component of the holistic product development process. Product decisions are thus made on this factual base. Involving users helps to better understand users and their challenges to detect possible stumbling blocks at an early stage.​ {.lead}


### Example

  title: 'Beispiel'
}) }}

We go to our users’ locations to interview or to observe them. We test our prototypes in the places where users carry out their work. This can be on the move, in the operations centre, the office, at the counter, on the train etc. {.lead}
