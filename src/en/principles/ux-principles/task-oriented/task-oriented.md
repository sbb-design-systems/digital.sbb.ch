Using the task as a starting point, we analyse the interplay of people, technology and the organisation as a whole and advocate for a suitable design. {.lead}


### Example

When a change is required, we consider what this means for the overall system (people, technology and the organisation). For example, from a technology perspective, electronic checklists can rigidly control the workflow. With regard to people and the organisation, this changes the flexibility in the processes. This may result in a lack of flexibility in the overall system for disruptions and fluctuations because the order of the checklist cannot be changed and the work task therefore can no longer be carried out safely and effectively. {.lead}
