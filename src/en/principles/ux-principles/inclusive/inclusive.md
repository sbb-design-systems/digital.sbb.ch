Our aspiration is to develop solutions that can be used regardless of individual impairments. We therefore also improve user experience during temporary impairments that could affect all our users.{.lead}


### Example

Temporary impairments could be a broken leg, a journey with a pushchair or bicycle or reading texts in strong sunlight.{.lead}
