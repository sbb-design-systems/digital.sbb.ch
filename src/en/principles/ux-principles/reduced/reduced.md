Our solutions support our users in carrying out a certain task – and in doing this as simply and effectively as possible. Only the information and functions necessary for the working step are suggested. This helps prevent cognitive overload.{.lead}


### Example
{{ principleImage({
  url: '/assets/images/principles/page/reduziert-beispiel',
  alt: 'Beispiel',
  title: 'Beispiel'
}) }}
We show the user only the necessary relevant information and avoid complex content. ​By consciously leaving out or hiding information at the first level, the operation/application is made simpler for users.​{.lead}

For example, on the timetable for the connection, only the start point, destination and number of stops are shown initially.{.lead}
