Which principles need to be taken into account for a good user experience?​{.lead}

The attention for user experience is growing within SBB and is no longer an important topic only for the UX team. ​ We have created the UX principles to strengthen a common view of how user experience should be understood and lived within SBB.​{.lead}

The six principles should be perceived as guidelines. They help you and everyone involved to ensure that UX concept decisions within your project can be aligned accordingly.​{.lead}

You can apply these principles as a tool for the entire duration of your project. ​At the beginning of a project, everyone who is involved should be aware of the principles. During the project you regularly check whether the principles are being taken into account in the design of the solution.​{.lead}
