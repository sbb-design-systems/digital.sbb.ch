## What does the component do?
A tag is a small labelling element that is used for categorisation and as a filter.

## When should the component be used?
* To filter and categorise content according to certain criteria.
* To allow users to search content according to defined properties.
* To make the user interface clearer.

## Rules
* Tags should be short and clearly labelled.
* Use a logical and intuitive order of tags to maximise usability.
* Avoid too many tags at once to ensure clarity.
