## What does the component do?
A message is a notification that informs users about information, successes, errors or other events in the application. Unlike a notification, it has no status and no option to hide itself. It is integrated into the layout and is suitable in particular for notifications within lists. 

## When should the component be used?
* To inform users about actions, e.g. success or error messages.
* In contrast to the Alert or Notification component, it generates less attention.
* It is well suited for messages in empty lists, for example.

## Rules
* The message must be integrated into the layout and should not be positioned like the alert or notification component.
