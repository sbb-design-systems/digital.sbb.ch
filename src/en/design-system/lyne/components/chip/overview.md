## What does the component do?
A chip is a compact, visual element that represents information, input or an action.

## When should the component be used?
* To display short, concise information.
* To display selected information/options in a form field.
* To enable interactions such as removing or selecting an option.

## Rules
* A chip should be labelled clearly and briefly.
* The label within the chip must not be too long and must always be displayed in a single line.
* Chips should have sufficient space between them to enable clear separation and simple operation.
