## What does the component do?
A select allows users to make a choice from a list of several options.

## When should the component be used?
* When users should make a selection from an extensive list of options.
* To save space on the user interface by hiding the options in a drop-down menu.
* When the number of choices is too large for radio buttons or checkboxes.

## Rules
* The options in the select menu should be clearly labelled and easy to understand.
* Use a useful default selection if this is relevant for the use case.
