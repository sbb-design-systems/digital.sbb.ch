## What does the component do?
A breadcrumb-group is a navigation help that shows users where they are within the hierarchy of a website and makes it easy to jump back to higher-level pages.

## When should the component be used?
* To show the user the current location within the website structure.
* To enable easy navigation between the levels of the website.
* To improve usability on pages with deep hierarchies.

## Rules
* A breadcrumb group should always start from the home page and display the complete path to the current page
* The individual levels in the breadcrumb group should be labelled clearly and understandably
* A breadcrumb-group should not display more than 5-7 levels in order to maintain clarity
