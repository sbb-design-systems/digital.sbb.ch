## What does the component do?
A divider is a visual dividing line that separates content or sections within a page or content block.

## When should the component be used?
* To create visual separation between different content or sections.
* To improve the structure and readability of content.
* To separate logical groups of elements and clarify the hierarchy of information.

## Rules
* A divider should be discreet and unobtrusive so as not to disrupt the flow of reading
* The length and alignment of the divider should be adapted to the surrounding layout and content (horizontal or vertical)
* Make sure that the divider has sufficient distance from the surrounding elements to fulfil its function as a separating element
