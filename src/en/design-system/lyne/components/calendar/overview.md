## What does the component do?
A calendar is a component that allows users to display and select date information.

## When should the component be used?
* To provide users with an easy way to view and manage date-dependent information like appointments.
* To enable the selection of date ranges for bookings or planning.
* To display recurring events and their patterns.

## Rules
* Individual months or entire years can be displayed.
* If the calendar is used in the date picker, only one date can be selected.
* If the calendar is used standalone, several dates can be selected.
* Individual days can have several statuses.
