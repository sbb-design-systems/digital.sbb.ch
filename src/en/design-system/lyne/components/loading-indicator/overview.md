## What does the component do?
A loading indicator shows that an action or process is running in the background and users have to wait for this process to finish.

## When should the component be used?
* To inform users that an action or process is running in the background.
* To cover waiting times.
* To give feedback that the application is responding to user input.

## Rules
* Only use the loading indicator for actions that last longer than a short moment.
* Make sure that the loading indicator does not interfere with the layout of the page or application.
* If possible, offer a progress indicator to give users an idea of the remaining waiting time, especially for long waiting times.
