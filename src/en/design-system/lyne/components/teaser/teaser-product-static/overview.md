## What does the component do?
A teaser is a preview that is intended to arouse users' curiosity and encourage them to click on further content or pages.

## When should the component be used?
* To highlight and promote content, articles, products or services.
* To make users aware of further information or interesting content.

## Rules
* Use a catchy and inviting headline and a short, interesting description.
* Do not use too many different teaser types and sizes on one page.
* Several teasers can be structured with one title.
* The teaser-product-static should only be used if the teaser is to contain several CTAs.
