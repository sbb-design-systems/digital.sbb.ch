## What does the component do?
A toggle enables users to switch between two states, e.g. "Off" and "On".

## When should the component be used?
* To provide a quick and easy way to activate or deactivate a function.
* When users need to change a setting that has an immediate effect.
* To present binary options clearly and intuitively.

### Rules
* Avoid placing too many toggles on a page to ensure clarity and maintain usability.
