## What does the component do?
A toggle-check allows users to switch between two states (usually "on" and "off" or "selected" and "not selected") and behaves identically to a checkbox.

## When should the component be used?
* To provide a quick and easy way to activate or deactivate a function.
* When users need to change a setting that has an immediate effect.
* To present binary options clearly and intuitively.

## Rules
* Avoid placing too many check toggles on a page to ensure clarity and maintain usability.
* Carefully consider which of the two components (checkbox and toggle-check) is more suitable.
