## What does the component do?
A container groups related content, defines distances to the previous and next container and can contain a sticky footer.

## When should the component be used?
* To group and structure content logically.
* To ensure consistent spacing and layout within a page or application.
* When a sticky footer is needed that stays at the bottom of the container.

## Rules
* All content (apart from header and footer) must be placed in a container. This means that at least one container must be used per page.
* The spacing of the containers can be adjusted if necessary.
