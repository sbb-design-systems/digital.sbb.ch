## What does the component do?
An action-group is a group of elements composed of buttons and links that are arranged together to bundle related actions and enable standardised usage.

## When should the component be used?
* To display several related actions compactly and clearly.
* To improve user guidance by grouping related actions.
* To save space and optimise the information architecture.

## Rules
* An action-group should consist of at least two and a maximum of three elements.
* The positioning of the elements inside the action group should fit smoothly into the overall design of the page.
* The order of the elements should be logical and user-friendly. Actions that continue the process should be displayed on the right, actions like "back" or "cancel" should be displayed on the left.
* There should only be one primary button.
