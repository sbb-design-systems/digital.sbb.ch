## What does the component do?
A button is an interactive element that triggers an action when it is clicked.

## When should the component be used?
* To perform a primary or secondary action on a page.
* To enable the user to submit forms.
* To enable interactions for example opening dialogues or navigating to another page.

## Rules
* A button should be clearly labelled and describe a specific action.
* Avoid using multiple primary buttons on a page; secondary buttons or links should be used instead.
