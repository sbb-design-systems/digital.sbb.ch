## What does the component do?
Skip links are navigation aids that allow users to quickly jump to important content on a page, especially for screen reader users and keyboard navigation.

## When should the component be used?
* To improve the accessibility of a website.
* When users need to get quickly to main content, menus or other important areas of the page.
* To allow users to skip long navigation sections and jump directly to relevant content.

## Rules
* Make sure that skip links are placed as the first interactive elements in the DOM so that they are immediately accessible via the keyboard.
* Use clear and concise labelling for each skip link to clearly identify the target areas.
* Skip links should allow the user to jump directly to the relevant section of the page without additional content or navigation steps.
