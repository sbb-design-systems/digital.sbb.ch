## What does the component do?
The Radio-Button-Panel has the same function as the Radio-Button. In addition to the normal Radio-Button, the Radio-Button-Panel offers the option of displaying subtexts, Card-Badges or Icons.

## When should the component be used?
* When users should make a selection from a limited number of options.
* When only one option may be selected from several possible options.
* If the Radio-Button-Panel fits better into the layout than the normal Radio-Button. 
* If further content (such as icons, texts, card badges) is required or the options of the normal checkbox are not enough to optimally describe the selection.
* If content of your choice is to be displayed below the Checkbox-Panel. For technical implementation, see "Selection-Expansion-Panel".

## Rules
* Radio-Button-Panels should be used in groups (radio-button-group) to provide a clear choice.
* Each option within a radio-button-group should be clearly labelled and easy to understand.
* Avoid placing too many options in a radio button group to ensure clarity and to make selection easier.
* Avoid too much content in the Radio-Button-Panel to ensure readability and clarity.
