## What does the component do?
A slider allows users to adjust a value or selection within a specified range by dragging a slider.

## When should the component be used?
* To provide users with a simple and intuitive way to adjust values within a certain range.
* When a precise or quick adjustment of a value is required.
* To save space on the user interface by using an interactive control.

## Rules
* Use labels and icons to make the value range of the slider clear.
* The slider should only be used for simple value ranges (from/to, fast/slow, heavy/light).
* The slider should not be used to indicate the progress of a process or operation.
* The slider should provide visual feedback when the value is changed, e.g. by displaying the current value next to the slider.
