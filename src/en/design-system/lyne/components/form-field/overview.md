## What does the component do?
The form field is a wrapper that ensures the standardised display and function of form components such as input (text, date, time), select and textarea.

## When should the component be used?
* Whenever an input, select or textarea is used.
* To ensure consistent design and alignment of form input components.

## Rules
* The use of form elements without a form field is not recommended. Should it be necessary for reasons, the presentation must be respected and must be guaranteed by the website or application.
