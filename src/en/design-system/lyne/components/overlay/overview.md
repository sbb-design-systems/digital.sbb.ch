## What does the component do?
An overlay is a view that hides or darkens the background in order to draw the focus to an important element such as a form.

## When should the component be used?
* To focus the user's attention on an important element (e.g. a form).

## Rules
* The background of the overlay can be semi-transparent or covering. The semi-transparent variant is suitable if background information is important for the user, for example to ensure orientation.
* Make sure that the overlay does not obscure any important background information that may be necessary for users.
