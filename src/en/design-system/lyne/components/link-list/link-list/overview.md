## What does the component do?
A link list is a collection of links that are grouped together and presented in a structured way to make it easier for users to access related content or important areas of a website.

## When should the component be used?
* To provide an overview of related or thematically organised links.
* To display important navigation points or resource collections in a structured way.
* To provide users with quick access to frequently used links or content.

## Rules
* Use descriptive and meaningful link texts to make the target content understandable.
* Make sure that the links in the list are logically grouped and thematically organised.
* Use consistent styles and behaviours for links within the link list.
* Avoid placing too many links in a list to avoid crowding and ensure clarity.
