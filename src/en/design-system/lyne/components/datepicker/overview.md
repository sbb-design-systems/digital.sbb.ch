## What does the component do?
A date picker is an input component that allows users to select a date from a calendar view.

## When should the component be used?
* To make it easier for users to select a specific date.
* To ensure accuracy and consistency of date entry.
* To provide a user-friendly alternative to manual date entry.

## Rules
* If possible, the date picker should display a default value, e.g. today's date.
* The date picker can be displayed with or without back and forward buttons.
* The date picker should be localised and respect the user's date format.
* Error messages (e.g. invalid date) should be displayed with a clear and understandable error message.
