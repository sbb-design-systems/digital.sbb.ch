## What does the component do?
A file selector is a component that allows users to select and upload files from their device.

## When should the component be used?
* To allow users to upload files, such as documents, images or videos.
* To complete forms that require file attachments.
* To collect files for storage, processing or sharing.

## Rules
* Users should be able to remove files.
* The progress of the file upload can be displayed to users, especially for larger files.
* The file selector supports both drag-and-drop and browsing files via a button. Depending on the available space, the appropriate variant should be selected.
