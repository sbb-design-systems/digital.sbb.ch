## What does the component do?
The header is the top section of a website or application that contains important navigation elements to make it easier for users to access the main areas of the site or application.

## When should the component be used?
* On every page of a website to ensure consistent navigation and brand presence.
* To make main navigation elements, logo, search functions and important links visible and easily accessible.
* To improve usability and orientation on the website.

## Rules
* Navigation elements should be logically grouped and labelled for easy navigation. They always have an icon (to the left of the label).
* If a hamburger menu is placed, it is always displayed first and to the left.
* The header should contain a search function if the website offers a lot of content.
* Avoid too many elements in the header so that clarity and responsive behaviour are not negatively affected.
