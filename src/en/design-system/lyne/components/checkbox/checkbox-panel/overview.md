## What does the component do?
The Checkbox-Panel has the same function as the Checkbox. In addition to the normal Checkbox, the Checkbox-Panel offers the option of displaying subtexts, Card-Badges or Icons.

## When should the component be used?
* To allow users to select multiple independent options.
* To offer a yes/no or on/off selection.
* To confirm consents or conditions (e.g. newsletter subscription).
* If the Checkbox-Panel fits better into the layout than the normal Checkbox. 
* If further content (such as icons, texts, card badges) is required or the options of the normal checkbox are not enough to optimally describe the selection.
* If content of your choice is to be displayed below the Checkbox-Panel. For technical implementation, see "Selection-Expansion-Panel".

## Rules
* Each checkbox should be clearly labelled and name the option unambiguously.
* Groups of checkboxes should be logically organised.
* Avoid too many options in a group in order to maintain clarity (max. 5-7 options).
* Avoid too much content in the Checkbox-Panel to ensure readability and clarity.
