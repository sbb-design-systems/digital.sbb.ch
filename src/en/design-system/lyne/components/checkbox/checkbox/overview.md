## What does the component do?
A checkbox is a selection field that allows users to select or deselect one or more options from a list.

## When should the component be used?
* To allow users to select multiple independent options.
* To offer a yes/no or on/off selection.
* To confirm consents or conditions (e.g. newsletter subscription).

## Rules
* Each checkbox should be clearly labelled and name the option unambiguously.
* Groups of checkboxes should be logically organised.
* Avoid too many options in a group in order to maintain clarity (max. 5-7 options).
