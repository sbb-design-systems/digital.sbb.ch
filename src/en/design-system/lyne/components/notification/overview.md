## What does the component do?
A notification is a message that informs users about important information, successes, errors or other events in the application.

## When should the component be used?
* To inform users about the status of actions, e.g. success or error messages.
* To display important system messages or updates.
* To inform users of required actions or changes.

## Rules
* Notifications should be clear and concise in order to convey the message quickly.
* Provide the option to close notifications manually or have them disappear automatically after a reasonable time.
* Use consistent positioning of notifications within a website or application.
