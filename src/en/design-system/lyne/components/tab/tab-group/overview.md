## What does the component do?
A tab-group allows users to switch between different content or views within the same page without reloading the page.

## When should the component be used?
* To group content thematically and present it in a structured way.
* To enable simple and intuitive navigation between different content or views.
* To save space on the user interface by displaying only part of the content at a time.

## Rules
* Tabs should be clearly labelled and easy to understand.
* The order and labelling of tabs should be logical and intuitive.
* Avoid too many tabs at once to ensure clarity and not overwhelm users.
