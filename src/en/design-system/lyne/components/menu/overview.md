## What does the component do?
A menu shows context-dependent actions or options for a defined element. It can be called up by another interactive element like e.g. a button. 

## When should the component be used?
* To provide users with quick access to frequently used actions or options that are relevant for a specific element.
* When compact and contextualised navigation is required.
* To increase usability by providing additional options directly at the point of action.

## Rules
* Menu options should be clearly labelled and easy to understand.
* Make sure that the menu options are logically grouped and arranged in a useful order.
* Avoid too many options in a context menu to ensure clarity and not overwhelm users.
