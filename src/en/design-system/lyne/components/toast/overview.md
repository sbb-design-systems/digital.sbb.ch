## What does the component do?
A toast is a short-term notification that appears at the edge of the screen to inform users about certain events, successes or errors.

## When should the component be used?
* To inform users about the successful completion of an action.
* To display temporary information or notifications that do not require user interaction.
* To quickly communicate errors or warnings.

## Rules
* Toasts should be clear and concise to get the message across quickly.
* Toasts should appear in a consistent position on the screen within a web page or application.
* Toasts should disappear automatically after a reasonable time or be able to be closed manually.
