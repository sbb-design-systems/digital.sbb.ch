## What does the component do?
The navigation component displays a list of navigation links that help users to navigate through the various areas of a website or application. This is displayed as an overlay and is hidden behind a hamburger menu.

## When should the component be used?
* To provide users with a clear and accessible way to navigate through the website or application.
* When compact navigation is required.

## Rules
* The navigation should be hidden behind a hamburger icon and placed as the first element in the header.
* The navigation links should be logically grouped and arranged in a sensible order.
