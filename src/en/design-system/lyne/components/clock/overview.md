The digital SBB clock is used in web applications or on dynamic customer information channels on the train or at the station. It imitates the motion of the physical SBB clock and adapts its design. The SBB watch is a registered trade mark. {.lead} 
 
## Use 
The digital SBB clock may be used by all licensed transport companies in Switzerland and for projects relating to public transport in Switzerland. It must be used exactly as it is specified. 
The clock should be placed on a solid-colour background; it should not be placed on pictures or graphics. On light backgrounds, the clock face is visually separated from the background using a grey frame; the version without the frame should be used on dark backgrounds. {.lead}   

## What does the component do?
The SBB clock gives the system time of the display unit in analogue form. The system time should be taken from a reliable time server, if this can be influenced. {.lead}   

## When should the component be used?
- The component is used wherever the exact time needs to be communicated. In most cases, this relates to display units with real-time information on public transport. {.lead}  
- The clock can also be used as a stylistic element, but the customer benefit must be guaranteed in all cases. {.lead}  

## Rules
- The minimum size of the clock must not be less than 75px x 75px. {.lead}
- Depending on the location it is used in, the minimum size must be adjusted to the viewing distance. As a rule of thumb, viewing distance / 60 = clock size (e.g. 3000mm / 60 = 50mm clock size). {.lead}   
- Only one clock should be used per page / view. {.lead}   
- The distance between the clock and the nearest elements (margin) must be at least 20% of the clockâ€™s diameter on each side. {.lead}
