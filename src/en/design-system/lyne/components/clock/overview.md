## What does the component do?
The Swiss railway station clock was designed in 1944 by Swiss engineer and designer Hans Hilfiker for the SBB. It is characterised by a very clear, minimalist design with black scale lines on a white background and bar-shaped, black hour and minute hands. There are no numerals. Important features are the second stop and the minute jump.

## When should the component be used?
* To display the current time on the website or in the application.
* To strengthen the SBB brand image and create recognition value.

## Rules
* The SBB clock should be true to the original and accurate in design and functionality.
* The watch should always display the correct time.
* The clock should fit smoothly into the overall design of the site or application without dominating it.
* The clock can be displayed in different sizes in order to adapt to the layout.
* It may only appear once per page.
* It is part of the footer.
* Customer applications should always include the clock.
* Internal applications should not display the clock.
