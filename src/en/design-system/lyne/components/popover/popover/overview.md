## What does the component do?
A popover is a small overlay that displays additional context or interactive content when users click or focus on an element.

## When should the component be used?
* To display additional information or actions without leaving the current page.
* When users need a detailed explanation or advanced options for a specific element.
* To display context-dependent content in a clear and space-saving way.

## Rules
* Make sure that the content of the popover works well and is usable on different devices and screen sizes. 
* Make sure that the popover does not contain too much information or elements to ensure clarity
* Avoid keeping several popovers open at the same time.
