## What does the component do?
Hides content (text and links) behind a title and an image. The corresponding content can be shown or hidden by clicking on the flip card.

## When should the component be used? 
* To structure content.
* To ensure/provide clarity.

## Rules
* Title and image are mandatory
* If possible, the detailed text should not be too long, or only long enough so that the flip card does not have to be enlarged after the details are displayed.
