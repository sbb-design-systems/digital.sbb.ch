Very cool! We are looking forward to your contribution. The first thing to determine is whether the component in question can be included in the design system. <sbb-link variant="inline" href="/{{page.lang}}/design-system/organisation/contributing/">Here</sbb-link> you can read how it's decided whether a component can be included or not.

In short form here:
* Your component must comply with the design principles and visually fit into the system.
* Your component must be accessible
* Your component must meet the coding standards
* Your component must be usable in other places as well
* Your component may not contain business logic
