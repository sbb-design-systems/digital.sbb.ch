Depending on the time horizon of your project, it can make sense to work with Lyne already. A first stable feature set is planned for the end of 2023 (without guarantee). Until then, Lyne will focus exclusively on customer applications. If you, or your project, are in a situation where you need to make a decision, please contact us. We will be happy to advise you and help you with the decision: <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" target="_blank" href="mailto:ux@sbb.ch">mailto:ux@sbb.ch</sbb-link>
