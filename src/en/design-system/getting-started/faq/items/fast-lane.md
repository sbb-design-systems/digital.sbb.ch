The first thing we recommend is to contact us. <sbb-link variant="inline" href="/{page.lang}}/design-system/organisation/contacts/" target="_blank">Here</sbb-link> you can find who to contact.
Our product owners are the best at estimating how fast a needed component can be delivered. Since digital.sbb.ch is a public platform, we choose not to display any contact information. However, as an internal/external SBB employee you will certainly know how to contact the corresponding product owner.
