Design tokens are small, reusable variables used to keep design attributes or styles consistent within a digital product (e.g., websites, apps, or user interfaces). They are an important part of design systems and help ensure consistency and scalability of designs across different platforms and devices.

They typically represent basic design elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, animations, and other values used in CSS, JavaScript, or other programming languages. They are independent of specific technologies and can be easily used in different environments and repositories.

## Some advantages

### Consistency
Using design tokens ensures that design elements are applied consistently, creating a uniform look and feel.

### Scalability
When design changes need to be made, they can be easily updated in one central location instead of having to change each individual element manually.

### Collaboration
Design tokens allow for easier collaboration between designers and developers by establishing a common "design language" that is understood by both.

### Applicability

Design tokens can be used across multiple technologies and platforms, simplifying the process of adjusting designs for different environments.
