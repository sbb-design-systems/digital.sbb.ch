In general, we try to produce as few breaking changes as possible. However, it can still occur that exactly this happens. Sorry for that! But there are a few little tricks that can help you to minimize unwanted effects:

- Read the update notes we publish. We mention when a breaking change is possible and when it is rather unlikely.
- Schedule updates: Take your time for updates, the more recent your files are the higher the chance that nothing will break.
- Pay attention to the date. Install older updates first, then the newer ones.
