No, currently there are no such plans. However, as this rumor persists, ESTA Web's PO has written an internal blog post: https://confluence.sbb.ch/display/CLEW/2022/12/09/sbb-angular%3A+Rumors+of+its+death+have+been+greatly+exaggerated.

Going forward, two scenarios may occur:
- Lyne web components will be used in the existing Angular library.
- A migration to Lyne will be offered (automated or partially automated).

Should the second scenario be chosen in the long term, a mode of operation is still planned for several years. Which of the two scenarios will happen is currently difficult to answer, this depends heavily on the further development of Angular and other dependencies.
