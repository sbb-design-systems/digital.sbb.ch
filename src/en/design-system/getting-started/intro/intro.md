You can think of the design system as a digital construction kit from which you take the components for an interface. In addition, a design system also defines the design language of a brand, e.g. how logo and colors may be used and the underlying design principles.{.lead}


## Why a design system?{.lead}

With a design system, we can efficiently keep SBB's digital presence (both internal and external) consistent across different devices. Design systems are popular: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and many others also have a design system.{.lead}


## Who is behind the design system?{.lead}

SBB's design system is developed jointly by ESTA Web, the App Bakery, DRSV UX, and brand management.{.lead}


## Can you develop a component for me?{.lead}

With the Design System, we offer a component construction kit that covers many but not all needs. If you need specific components that are not available in the design system, you can develop them yourself in your project.{.lead}


## How can I add something to the design system?{.lead}

A design system can and should grow, but there are certain constraints. See <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/{{page.lang}}/design-system/organization/contributing/">Contribution</sbb-link> for more information on this.{.lead}


## Can I also use the design system for internal applications?{.lead}

The design system can also be used for internal applications. Primarily there is the design system "Web Lean".{.lead}
