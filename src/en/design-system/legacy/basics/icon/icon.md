## Use
Icons provide visual support for themes and actions. The icons in the SBB style must be used in SBB applications. Details on this and a set of already available icons can be found <sbb-link variant="inline" href="/en/foundation/assets/icons/">here</sbb-link>.{.lead}

## Rules
* The use of icons within body copy should be avoided as far as possible.{.lead}
* Icons without text must be self-explanatory or easy to learn. The more icons used in an application, the more difficult it becomes to understand their meaning.{.lead}
* Icons should always have the same meaning (consistency) across all applications.{.lead}

## Accessibility
* Icons without text must include an alternative text.{.lead}
* The icon itself does not have to be described but instead its function in text form (e.g. ‘close menu’).{.lead}
