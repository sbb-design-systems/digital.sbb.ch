## What does the element do?
Images support the understanding of texts and loosen up text-heavy pages. {.lead}

## When should the element be used?
* Images can be used to support textual communication (with visual communication). {.lead}
* Large (content-wide) images should be used sparingly. {.lead}

## Rules 
* The preparation of pictures and illustrations is regulated by the specifications of KOM (see links). {.lead}
* Use illustrations and infographics as SVG, ensure high enough resolution for all screen sizes for photographs. {.lead}
* Apart from the red SBB panel, pictures may not contain any overlays. {.lead}
* Only context-relevant images may be used (the image must match the content). {.lead}
* Combining different styles can positively influence the UX (photography for realities, illustrations for concepts) {.lead}
* Different image sizes can help to emphasize (prioritize) the importance of images. {.lead}
* Optionally, images can have a description text (caption). {.lead}
