## What does the component do?
Structured display of data. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* It is used for displaying data and not for structuring content. {.lead}
* Tables should be structured so that they grow vertically (lines) when data sets are added. {.lead}

## Rules
* Header text can be multi-line. {.lead}
* The background of the content lines alternates between white and grey. The first content line always starts with a white background. {.lead}
* Header and content texts can be left-aligned, right-aligned or centred within the table cell. {.lead}
* Legends and table captions are listed directly under the table left-aligned. {.lead}
* No images are permitted in tables. {.lead}
* Empty table cells are filled with a hyphen. {.lead}
* No accentuation or links are permitted in the header text. {.lead}
* Every column must have a header text (accessibility). {.lead}
* The following applies to table and mobile views: If the table is wider than the viewport and the first column is defined as a header column, the first column is fixed. The other columns can then be swiped to the left. {.lead}
* Units of measurement of content are shown in the column or line header. {.lead}
