## What does the component do?
It categorises a large amount of information.{.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* For filtering results with lots of categories.{.lead}
* In a tag cloud as a link tag to use jump points to a new category page.{.lead}

## Rules
* A tag always has an indicator which shows how many results are behind it.{.lead}
* The tag is always positioned on the left in content pages and is always centred in overview pages.{.lead}
* The order of the tags is determined editorially.{.lead}
* The term in the tag is always single-line (no line breaks) and the tag itself increases in width with the text.{.lead}
* If a tag becomes too long for the viewport due to the text, the text is shortened with ‘…’.{.lead}
