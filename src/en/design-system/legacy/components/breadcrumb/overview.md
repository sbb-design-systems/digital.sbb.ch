## What does the component do?
It is used to display the navigation hierarchy of the current page. {.lead}

## When should the component be used? 
On every page where the user should be able to navigate quickly to a sister or parent page. {.lead}

## Rules
* The breadcrumb is always positioned directly beneath the header. The exception is when a <sbb-link variant="inline" href="/en/design-system/legacy/components/ghettobox">ghettobox</sbb-link> is shown, then the breadcrumb follows immediately after the last ghettobox. {.lead}
* The breadcrumb can be multi-line for long entries. {.lead}
* All levels are always shown on the desktop and tablet. {.lead}
* Only the last levels are written out on the mobile. Preceding levels are shown on a single one with ‘…’. All intermediate levels are show if ‘…’ is clicked on. {.lead}
* If the horizontal width of the viewport on the mobile is not sufficient to show all levels, the breadcrumb content is scrollable. {.lead}
