## What does the component do?
It is used to structure the display of data and forms. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* When switching between different aspects within the same context. {.lead}
* When the content of various aspects cannot be seen at the same time by the user. {.lead}

## Rules
* There are at least two tabs. {.lead}
* The first tab is always selected by default. {.lead}
* The tab names are always single-line. {.lead}
* The tab name should be as simple and concise as possible so that the themes can be quickly understood. {.lead}
* If the tab is too long for the viewport, the other tabs can be reached with a horizontal scrollbar (desktop) or by swiping (tablet/mobile). {.lead}
* Another tab module is not permitted within a tab (tab-in-tab). {.lead}
