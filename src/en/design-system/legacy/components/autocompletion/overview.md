## What does the component do?
It supports the user when entering suggestions.{.lead}

## When should the component be used? 
* When an entry field can have lots of pre-defined values.{.lead}
* As an aid for previewing search results/fields.{.lead}

## Rules
* Autocompletion always has a label.{.lead}
* Optional entries include the text ‘(optional)’ behind the label text. The text ‘(optional)’ can be abbreviated as ‘(opt.)’ in short fields.{.lead}
* A question mark in the circle can also be shown – in addition to the label – for detailed explanations. A <sbb-link variant="inline" href="/en/design-system/legacy/components/tooltip">tooltip</sbb-link> opens if this question mark is clicked on.{.lead}
* During entry, suggestions appear directly (usually after three symbols but they can be modified on a project-specific base).{.lead}
* The entries listed can be scrolled through using the arrow keys and accepted with Enter.{.lead}
* A maximum of ten suggestions are shown.{.lead}
* The autocompletion selection closes when an element is selected.{.lead}
