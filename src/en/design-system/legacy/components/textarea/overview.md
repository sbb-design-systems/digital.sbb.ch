## What does the component do?
It is used for the entry of large amounts of text in forms. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
When the entry of longer text is required from the user. {.lead}

## Rules
* The textarea always has a label. {.lead}
* Optional entries include the text ‘(optional)’ behind the label text. The text ‘(optional)’ can be shortened to ‘(opt.)’ for short fields. {.lead}
* A question mark in the circle – in addition to the label – can be used for detailed explanations. A <sbb-link variant="inline" href="/en/design-system/legacy/components/tooltip">tooltip</sbb-link> opens when this question mark is clicked on. {.lead}
* The number of characters still available is shown bottom right (outside the text area is disabled). {.lead}
* The width of the text area is always the same as the entire width of the form. {.lead}
* The basic height can be set when designing the form. {.lead}
* If the text is longer than the basic height of the textarea, the element increases in height with the content. {.lead}
