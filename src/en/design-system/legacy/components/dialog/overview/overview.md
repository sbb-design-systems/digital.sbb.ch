## What does the component do?
It is used to display detailed information of a content page.{.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* If detailed or additional information has to be shown on-demand on part of a page (for example, additional support when the <sbb-link variant="inline" href="/{{page.lang}}/design-system/legacy/components/tooltip">tooltip</sbb-link> is not sufficient).{.lead}
* To display the editing mode on forms.{.lead}
* For an enlarged view of images.{.lead}

## Rules
* The referenced page is not left.{.lead}
* When the lightbox opens, it always fills the browser window.{.lead}
* The lightbox has its own header which is always sticky.{.lead}
* Only content-describing information may appear in the header (for example, the train number).{.lead}
* The lightbox content can be created as part of basic design.{.lead}
