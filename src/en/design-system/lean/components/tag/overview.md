## What does the component do?
It categorises a large amount of information. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* For filtering results with lots of categories. {.lead}

## Rules
* A tag always has an indicator which shows how many results are behind it. {.lead}
* The term in the tag is always single-line (no line breaks) and the tag itself increases in width with the text. {.lead}
* If a tag becomes too long for the viewport due to the text, the text is shortened with «...». {.lead}
