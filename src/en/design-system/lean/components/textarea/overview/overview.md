## What does the component do?

## Rules 
* The text area always has a label.{.lead}
* A question mark in the circle can also be shown – in addition to the label – for detailed explanations. A <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/{{page.lang}}/design-system/lean/components/tooltip">tooltip</sbb-link> opens when this question mark is clicked on.{.lead}
* The number of characters still available is shown bottom right (outside the text area is disabled).{.lead}
* The basic height can be set when designing the form.{.lead}
* If the text is longer than the basic height of the text area, the element increases in height with the content.{.lead}
