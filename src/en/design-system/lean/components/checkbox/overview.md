## What does the component do?
* It is used for the entry of yes/no values. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* When selecting an option. {.lead}
* When selecting several options that are independent of one another. {.lead}

## Rules 
* A checkbox is only permitted within forms. {.lead}
* Several checkboxes can be arranged vertically or horizontally. The vertical layout is preferred as it allows the user to understand the options more quickly. {.lead}
* Horizontal layout only for two to three options and short names. {.lead}
* The text can be multi-line. {.lead}
* In addition to the actual checkbox, the entire text can also be used as a click target. {.lead}
* A title can be used above a checkbox group. {.lead}
* A question mark in the circle can be show – in addition to the title – for detailed explanations on a checkbox group. A <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/tooltip/">tooltip</sbb-link> opens when this question mark is clicked on. {.lead}
