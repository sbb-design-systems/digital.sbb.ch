## What does the component do?
* Displays hierarchically structured data in a tree structure.{.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* To display and select elements in a hierarchical structure.{.lead}

## Rules
* When using a tree as a navigation component, it makes sense not to use too many hierarchy levels (recommendation max. 3).{.lead}
* When using an tree to display data structures (e.g. a dossier, analogous to a file browser), it depends on the application how many hierarchy levels are needed.{.lead}
* The icon as a supplement to the text is optional.{.lead}
