## What does the component do? 
* It is used for the selection of one or more options from a pre-defined list. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* For the selection of several options (selection of single or multiple options) from a list. {.lead}
* If a selection must be made where the entries mutually exclude one another and no default value is to be set (in contrast to the <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/radiobutton">radiobutton</sbb-link> element). {.lead}
* When selection options are to be grouped. {.lead}

## Rules
* There must be a choice of at least two options. {.lead}
* The component always has a label. {.lead}
* A question mark in the circle can also be shown – in addition to the label – for detailed explanations. A <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/tooltip">tooltip</sbb-link> opens when this question mark is clicked on. {.lead}
* The text in the select component is always single-line. {.lead}
* If an entry is longer than the available width of the component, the entry’s text is abbreviated with ‘…’. {.lead}
* A pre-selection is not permitted with a mandatory field. {.lead}
* If no selection has been made yet, the component text says “please select …”. {.lead}
