## What does the component do?
* It is used to structure the display of data and forms. {.lead}

## When should the component be used? 
* For switching between various aspects within the same context. {.lead}
* When the content of various aspects cannot be seen at the same time by the user. {.lead}

## Rules
* The first tab is always selected by default. {.lead}
* The tab names are always single-line. {.lead}
* The tab name should be as simple and concise as possible so that the themes can be quickly understood. {.lead}
* If the tab is too long for the viewport, the width is shortened and the names are shortened with “…”. When hovering over the tab, the complete name appears in a <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/tooltip">tooltip</sbb-link>. {.lead}
* Another tab component is not permitted within a tab (tab-in-tab). {.lead}
