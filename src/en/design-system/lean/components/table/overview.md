## What does the component do?
* Structured display of data within a table.{.lead}

## When should the component be used? 
* It is used for displaying data, not for structuring content.{.lead}
* Tables should be structured so that they grow vertically (lines) when data sets are added.{.lead}

## Rules
* Table cells may contain just information (e.g. text, person, status display, icon) or interaction elements (e.g. text field, select, button).{.lead}
* Every column must have a header (including text or icon).{.lead}
* Headers can contain subtitles in addition to the title.{.lead}
* Header and line content may be left-aligned, right-aligned or centred within the table cell: Text left-aligned, icons centred, numbers right-aligned{.lead}
* Units of measurement in content are ideally entered on the second line of the column header. Alternatively, they can appear directly next to the column header name in round brackets.{.lead}
* Horizontal scrolling should be avoided as far as possible.{.lead}
* Columns can be put into logical groups. There is no dividing line between grouped columns.{.lead}
* Large amounts of data can be divided up using <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/pagination">pagination</sbb-link>. Alternatively, infinite scrolling can be used if required.{.lead}
* Keyboard operation: between the lines can be navigated using the arrow keys (up, down).{.lead}
