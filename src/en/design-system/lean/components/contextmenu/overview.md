## What does the component do?
* It provides context-specific actions, either dynamically via right mouse click on an element or statically via an icon. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* When actions for efficient execution are to be provided on an object depending on the status or role of the user. {.lead}

## Rules
* A context menu can be provided via the right mouse click or via an icon. {.lead}
* The context menu may contain icons but does not have to. {.lead}
* On a level of the context menu, there is either an icon for all menu items or none at all. {.lead}
* Menu items can be grouped. Groups are separated by a dash. {.lead}
* A context menu can be used for sorting elements. In this case, an arrow is used to show which attribute is used for sorting and in which direction. {.lead}
* Providing deeper level structures is also permitted. However, it is worth noting that the more complex, the less efficient it is to use. {.lead}
