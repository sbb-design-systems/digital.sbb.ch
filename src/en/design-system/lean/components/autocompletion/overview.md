## What does the component do?
* It helps the user with entry by providing suggestions. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* When an entry field can have lots of pre-defined values. {.lead}
* As a tool for previewing search results/fields. {.lead}

## Rules
* The auto-completion always has a label. {.lead}
* Optional entries include the text ‘(optional)’ behind the label text. The text ‘(optional)’ can be shortened to ‘(opt.)’ in short fields. {.lead}
* A question mark in the circle – in addition to the label – can be used for detailed explanations. A <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/tooltip/">tooltip</sbb-link> opens if this question mark is clicked on. {.lead}
* During entry three suggestions appear (usually after three symbols but this can be modified on a project-specific base). {.lead}
* The listed entries can be scrolled through using arrow keys and accepted with ‘Enter’. {.lead}
* A maximum of ten suggestions are shown. {.lead}
* The auto-completion selection closes when an element is chosen. {.lead}
