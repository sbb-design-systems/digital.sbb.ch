## What does the component do? 
* It is used to show what stage of a process a user is on. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* In all processes where a user has to go through several steps/pages to complete them. {.lead}

## Rules
* The process flow is always at the top, positioned directly after the <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/breadcrumb">breadcrumb</sbb-link>. {.lead}
* The user can navigate back to a process step already passed through in the process flow. {.lead}
* Forward navigation in the process is only permitted through the call-to-action of the page concerned. Skipping (forward) of steps is not permitted. {.lead}
