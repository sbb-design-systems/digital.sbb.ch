## What does the component do?

## When should the component be used?
* When there are two or more options and the options mutually exclude one another. {.lead}

## Rules
* A radio button is only permitted within a form. {.lead}
* There must be a choice of at least two options. {.lead}
* A pre-selection is mandatory. {.lead}
* Radio buttons can be arranged vertically or horizontally. The vertical layout is preferred as it allows the user to understand the options more quickly. {.lead}
* The text can be multi-line. {.lead}
* In addition to the actual radio button, the entire text can also be used as a click target. {.lead}
* A title can be used above a radio button group. {.lead}
* A question mark in the circle can also be shown – in addition to the title – for detailed explanations on a radio button group. A <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/design-system/lean/components/tooltip">tooltip</sbb-link> opens if this question mark is clicked on. {.lead}
