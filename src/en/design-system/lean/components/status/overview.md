## What does the component do? 
* It shows the status of an object. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* When the status of an object has to be shown permanently and prominently. {.lead}

## Rules
* The images below show examples of states. The states are defined specifically for each application and the <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/foundation/colors/base-colors">colors</sbb-link> and <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/en/foundation/assets/icons">icons</sbb-link> are therefore also selected appropriately. {.lead}
