## What does the component do?
* It is used to display messages that concern an entire page. {.lead}

## When should the component be used?
* If a user has triggered an action on a page and should receive feedback from the system. {.lead}
* Or if a technical problem exists that prevents the user from working. {.lead}

## Rules
* Notifications always only appear after an action has been triggered by the user. {.lead}
* The width can be based on the width of a form, the entire content area or a standard width with use as toast. {.lead}
* The height is based on the length of the message text. {.lead}
* If the user is prevented from continuing to work (by an error), the application is blocked by frosted glass. In this case, the notification cannot be clicked away either (the ‘X’ is not then shown). {.lead}
