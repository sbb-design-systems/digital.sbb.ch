## Add Asset

In order for an asset to be added, the following steps are required: {.lead} 
* Create <sbb-link variant="inline" href="https://github.com/signup">Github account</sbb-link> and log in. {.lead} 
* <sbb-link variant="inline" href="https://github.com/sbb-design-systems/digital.sbb.ch/issues/new/choose">Open</sbb-link> community asset form. {.lead} 
* Fill in form. {.lead} 
* Note: The Figma link may not be used more than once (works as a key). If a link is used more than once, assets will be overwritten. {.lead} 
* After filling in the form, the website should be updated after approx. 10 minutes and the ticket will be closed automatically. {.lead}

## Change asset

To overwrite an asset, the form can be filled out again using the same Figma link (with the appropriate corrections). {.lead} 

## Delete asset

Currently it is not possible to delete an asset. Write us which asset should be deleted to <sbb-link variant="inline" href="mailto:ux@sbb.ch">ux@sbb.ch</sbb-link>. {.lead}
