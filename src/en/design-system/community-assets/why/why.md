## What are community assets
They are assets (components, patterns, templates, design tokens, etc.) that can emerge from different projects within the community.{.lead} 

## Why
Not all assets that emerge from projects can or should be incorperated into the design system. Nevertheless, they can also be useful for other projects. With a <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/{{page.lang}}/design-system/community-assets/catalogue/">repository</sbb-link> on this site a centralized collection of these assets should arise in order to reach the following goals:{.lead}
- Simplify communication
- Save resources (avoid redundancies)
- Identify patterns that should be transfered to the design sysem
- Increase consistency/coherence across the SBB.
