Products of the SBB should be usable by as many people in as many situations as possible. This includes, in particular, users with disabilities. The consideration of digital accessibility provides the flexibility, to use a product independently of personal or situational limitations. {.lead}

## Why accessibility?
Accessibility belongs as standard in good product design. Usability and User Experience are closely related topics and it has been shown that accessible solutions offer advantages to all users. {.lead}

In addition, SBB is legally obliged to make available all travel-related information in an accessible way. This is stipulated at national level by the <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" target="_blank" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behindertengleichstellungsgesetz">Law on Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities</sbb-link> (BehiG).

## Who is accessibility for?
Accessibility is important for all users. Almost everyone experiences at least one type of disability in the course of their life, whether permanent, temporary or in certain situations. For example, a person with impaired vision relies on good contrast. Optimum contrast settings are also helpful after eye operations for temporary sight problems. And people who can see well also benefit, for example when they wish to read content on their phones outdoors in bright sunlight. {.lead}

According to the Federal Statistical Office, around <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" target="_blank" href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/economic-social-situation-population/equality-people-disabilities/disabilities.html">21% of the population</sbb-link> live with some form of disability. {.lead}
