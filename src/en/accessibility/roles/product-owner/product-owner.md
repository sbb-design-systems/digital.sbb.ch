Ensure that accessibility is considered in each story and is adopted as an acceptance criterion. This will save you a great deal of corrective work and stress. Barrier-free products are the result of continuous consideration of measures that contribute to accessibility.{.lead}

## <sbb-icon name="circle-tick-medium"></sbb-icon> Maintain the priority{.with-icon}

## <sbb-icon name="circle-tick-medium"></sbb-icon> Plan an external review promptly{.with-icon}
Ensure sufficient time when planning an external review or any <sbb-link variant="inline" type="button" href="/{{page.lang}}/accessibility/introduction/further-information/">certification</sbb-link> of accessibility. A typical review through Access For All takes around two weeks. Ideally, you should register for this at least two months in advance.{.lead}
