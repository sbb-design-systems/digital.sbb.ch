You publish texts and other content.{.lead}

## <sbb-icon name="circle-tick-medium"></sbb-icon> Prioritise content{.with-icon}
Ensure that the really important things can be easily identified. Construct the headlines and texts in such a way that everything can be scanned and the relevant information can be found quickly by users.{.lead}

## <sbb-icon name="circle-tick-medium"></sbb-icon> Use clear language{.with-icon}
Write in a clear and consistent language. Avoid jargon and idioms. Use clear headlines to structure your content.{.lead}

## <sbb-icon name="circle-tick-medium"></sbb-icon> Write good alternative texts{.with-icon}
Images must have an alternative text and videos must have subtitles. With images, take care that the communicated meaning is described, not the image itself. Don't provide important content just through pictures. Purely decorative images are supported with an empty alternative text.{.lead}

## <sbb-icon name="circle-tick-medium"></sbb-icon> Self-explanatory links{.with-icon}
Make sure that all your links are self-explanatory. For example, several uses of ‘Continue’ should not be used; better to use ‘Continue to login’.{.lead}

Testing: Hide the text next to the link. Is it still understandable?{.lead}
